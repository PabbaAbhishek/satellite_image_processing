# Satellite_image_processing

This is the basic satellite image processing example code. Here, I used a imgaery file secured from planet.com and from analyzing it, I produced a vegetation map in the region.


The jupyter notebook is uploaded. Before running it, download the imagery from the link https://hello.planet.com/data/s/UG2TX98suVmmi9q/download
These are the packages needed to run the code:
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Rasterio

I'm also including the Qgis file, to further manipulate with the data.
